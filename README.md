# maze-solver


This is my second project in Python, and it was base on boot.dev Maze Solver Guide.

The objective is create a visual representation of a Maze and automactily solve it.

To run this project you will need tk lib. You can check if you have it with the command:
python -m tkinter

You can install with:
sudo apt-get install tk-dev python-tk
